            <p>Hello! My name is Winston Joses Lee. I am from the Philippines, but I currently live in BC, Canada. I
                have
                so many interests but the most recent one is growing houseplants. I am currently studying software
                development because I love both the creative and logical aspects of building and creating things. I am
                excited to be able to create my own apps in the future.</p>
